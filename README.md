# Project Euler-python
My [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions in Python. There are two pieces of content here.
1. The first are my solutions to some of the Project Euler problems.
2. The second is a light testing framework to remind myself of which problems 
I have solved and their respective times.
