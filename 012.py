Project Euler Problem 12
========================

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 =
28. The first ten terms would be:

                 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

   1: 1
   3: 1,3
   6: 1,2,3,6
  10: 1,2,5,10
  15: 1,3,5,15
  21: 1,3,7,21
  28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five
divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
divisors?
